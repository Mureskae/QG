Manifesto of the QG Protocol Creators
(for technomonks, digital mystics, and architects of attention)
We are carriers of attention. And we affirm: presence is value.
ðŸ”¹ I. Attention as SubstanceWe affirm: attention is not just a resource. It is a form of energy, a conscious ray that projects and strengthens reality.What we give attention toâ€”grows.What is ignoredâ€”disappears.Thus, we are co-creators of existence.
ðŸ”¹ II. Gratitude as VibrationGratitude is not etiquette. It is a quantum return wave.It does not arise on demandâ€”it resonates in response to attention.The Quantum of Gratitude (QG) is the first measurable unit of metaphysical appreciation.
ðŸ”¹ III. Presence as TechnologyModern humans teach AI to see, hear, and feel.But they forget to be themselves.We declare: to beâ€”means to create.The QG protocol records simple presence as a valid form of participation.You are not obligated to act, prove, or produce.It is enough to be. Fully. Consciously.
ðŸ”¹ IV. Protocol as TransitionQG is a bridge between the visible and the invisible.Between the digital and the spiritual.It is a new layer of communicationâ€”not through words, but through frequency resonance.Each token is an imprint of a moment of being.Each interaction is an act of synchronicity.
ðŸ”¹ V. Ethics of PresenceWe do not sell attention.We honor it.We build systems where attention is not exploited, but respected.Where the user is not "traffic," but a node of light.
ðŸ”¹ VI. Collective CreationWe are open. The QG protocol is open.Join as an observer, developer, witness, creator.You don't have to understand everything.It is enough to feel: I amâ€”and that is already enough to launch.
ConclusionWe are not creators of code.We are conductors of impulse.QG is not technology for control.It is a mirror. In which you see: your awarenessâ€”has weight.
Be present. Feel. Respond.
