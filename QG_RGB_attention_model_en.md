QG: Energy Attention Measurement Model through RGB Tokens

Introduction

QG (Quantum Gratitude) is a system that measures a person's presence and interaction in digital space using three tokens (R, G, B). It is not limited to metaphysics: QG is based on real measurable quantities available with modern technology.

Main Idea

Every pixel, every color we perceive or generate carries the energy of attention. In QG, this energy is digitized and converted into three tokens: red (R), green (G), and blue (B). These tokens reflect not only the amount of attention but also the quality of interaction.

Interpretation of RGB Channels

| Channel | Technical Measurement       | Energy in QG                             | Feature                             |
|---------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| R (Red) | Red color intensity (0–65535) | Emotional energy — emotional response strength, passion, activity | Active engagement, motivation      |
| G (Green) | Green color intensity (0–65535) | Cognitive energy — focus, balance, harmony | Connection of mind and perception  |
| B (Blue) | Blue color intensity (0–65535) | Intuitive energy — calmness, depth of attention | Inner reflection, presence         |

Mathematical Model

Parameters:  
- \( (R_t, G_t, B_t) \) — channel values at time \( t \) (0…65535)  
- \( (W_r, W_g, W_b) \) — channel weight coefficients (e.g., \( W_r=1.2 \), \( W_g=1.0 \), \( W_b=0.8 \))  
- \( C_h \) — attention flow coherence index (0…1)  
- \( k \) — energy to QG token conversion coefficient  
- \( T \) — measurement period  

Energy of attention at time \( t \):  
\[
E_t = W_r R_t + W_g G_t + W_b B_t
\]

Accumulated amount of QG tokens over period \( T \):  
\[
QG = \left( \sum_{t=0}^{T} E_t \right) C_h k
\]

Model Value

- Different channel weights allow adapting the system for various tasks (social networks, educational platforms, meditation practices).  
- Coherence provides an assessment not only of quantity but also of the quality of attention.  
- 16-bit color depth ensures ultra-precise measurements and opens up possibilities for new types of tokens.

Conclusion

QG with RGB tokens and the coherence coefficient creates a foundation for a new digital economy where value is determined not by noise, but by quality presence. This system unites physical data and semantic interpretation, providing people with a tool for more harmonious interaction with the world.
